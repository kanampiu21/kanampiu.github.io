I am a PhD candidate of Linguistics and English Language at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests lie in how humans learn language and how cognitive factors interact with environmental factors to drive language change. My dissertation focuses on accounting for morhosyntactic variation within the nominal phrase in a Bantu language, Kîîtharaka.

def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
